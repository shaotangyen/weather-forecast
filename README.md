# ðŸ“– Weather Dashboard

## ðŸ’¡ The Dashboard

This is a server-side API dashboard using open API to get weather data. User can either enter a city name, or click on a history searched city to look up  it's current and future weather.

## ðŸ’¡ The design

* There are 1 HTML, 1 CSS and 1 Javascript files.

* The index.html provides the fundamental layout of the web page using bootstrap.

* The script.js handles user clicks, store history data, retrive weather API data and render them on the dashboard.

* The style.css contains styles of the pages. Most styles are using bootstrap classes

* When the page loads, it automatically loads Sydney's weather if there's no local stored data. If there is, it loads the latest searched city data.

* If use clicks on the history data, it will use the city name and display the current and future weather (instead of display old weather data). So whenever a city is clicked, it calls the API again for the most updated data.
